.SH DESCRIPTION
Gadu\-Gadu is very popular instant messenger for MS Windows in Poland.

\fIhttp://www.kadu.net\fP

.SH ENVIRONMENT
On startup \fIkadu\fP chacks if \fB$CONFIG_DIR\fP variable is set. If not,
\fIkadu\fP will use default directory (which is \fI$HOME/.kadu\fP) to store
it's configuration files. However, one may wish to run another instance of
\fIkadu\fP, for different Gadu-Gadu account, on the same system account. In
such case, one needs to set \fB$CONFIG_DIR\fP so it points to the directory
that is supposed to hold configuration files for the other account.
