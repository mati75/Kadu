kadu (0.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release
  * debian/patches:
    - 01-libgadu_Makefile.patch - make distclean breaks the libgadu sources.
      This patch avoids deleting libgadu/config.h.in, libgadu/configure and
      libgadu/aclocal.m4
    - 02-.config.patch - This patch selects all modules and all additional
      icons and emoticons themes (exceptions are encryption and mail modules,
      which are not selected due to OpenSSL's license vs. GPL incompatibility)
    - 03-about-dialog.patch - Originally "About..." dialog reads contents of
      AUTHORS, THANKS, LICENSE and ChangeLog files from the /usr/share/kadu/
      directory. These files are moved to /usr/share/doc/kadu/ and this patch
      makes "About..." dialog read from proper directory. Also ChangeLog is
      installed as about-changes-tab.txt.
  * debian/extract.sh:
    Kadu has a mechanism called "autodownload". It's purpose is to fetch
    external modules and themes (selected in .config file) by a configure
    script. This is unacceptable for Debian source package, because such data
    wouldn't be verifiable. external directory holds all these modules and
    themes and debian/extract.sh unpacks the tarballs, overriding autodownload
    mechanism.
  * Voice module has to be linked against patched version of libgsm to work
    properly, that's why libgsm is shipped with the module and linked
    statically.
  * Contents of all tabs in an "About..." dialog are read directly from
    AUTHORS, THANKS, LICENSE and (after applying 03-about-dialog.patch)
    about-changes-tab.txt. That's why these files cannot be gzipped.
