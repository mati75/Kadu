	 * would give. It may be also overwritten by CONFIG_DIR environment variable
	 * and --config-dir command-line option (the latter takes precedence). We will
	 * call it CONFIG_DIR in this description, not matter which way it was set.

	 * treated as relative to the application's current directory. Else, if it is

	 * the path returned by the homePath() method or, if a file named "portable"

	 * the path returned by the dataPath() method.

	 * and Mac OS X exists, this directory is used as the current user profile for compatibility
	 * with Kadu 0.6.5 and older.
