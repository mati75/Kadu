 * This repository holds instances of ChatWidget. All instances are owned

 *
 * Instances are added by addChatWidget(std::unique_ptr&lt;ChatWidget&gt;) which
 * transfers ownership of chat widget to repository. It also emits
 * chatWidgetAdded(ChatWidget*) signals.
 *
 * Instances are removed by removeChatWidget(ChatWidget*) methods. Signal
 * chatWidgetRemoved(ChatWidget*) is removed and chat widget is destroyed.
 *
 * Instances can be enumerated as ChatWidget* in standard for-range loop as
 * begin() and end() iterators are provided.
