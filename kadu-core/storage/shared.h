/**
 * @author Rafal 'Vogel' Malinowski
 * @class Shared
 * @short UuidStorableObject that acts like QSharedData - can be used as data for many SharedBase object.
 *
 * This class stores data for @link SharedBase @endlink objects that allows many places of code to access
 * data of one object without concerning about copying, creating or destroying object. Many SharedBase objects
 * can contain the same Shared object (so the same data) - especially copied objects, so every change
 * in one of them is immediately visible in all other. Setter
 *
 * Support for notyfiing of any changes to this object is also available. Every change calls
 * @link dataUpdated @endlink method (that can be overridden and used to send a signal). To block
 * this method (when multiple changes are performed at once) @link blockUpdatedSignal @endlink
 * can be called. Then first change creates deffered call that is executed after call of
 * @link unblockUpdatedSignal @endlink (multiple calls of blockUpdatedSignal requires as much calls
 * of unblockUpdatedSignal to call doEmitUpdated).
 *
 * Note that because of QExplicitlySharedDataPointer implementation details it is not guaranteed that in
 * some method when you do something causing directly or not to remove the last @link SharedBase @endlink
 * object that refers to this object, this object will be deleted after your method ends. Actually, the object
 * may be deleted in the middle of it, so when such last reference loss is possible in a method, you need
 * to create a @link SharedBase @endlink guard object on the stack that will delay deletion to the moment
 * when the stack unrolls and destroys that @link SharedBase @endlink object or even avoid deletion at all
 * if after removing the last reference you set up another one.
