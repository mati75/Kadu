 * @param ManagerClass singleton class that will be informed about details loading/unloading from this holder
 * @short Object that holds extra data and informs ManagerClass singleton about loading/unloading this extra data.
 *
 * Some object (@link<Account> Account @endlink, @link<Contact> Contact @endlink and others)
 * have common data that should be always available and protocol data that can only be loaded
 * when protocol plugin is loaded. Common data is stored in normal @link<StorableObject>
 * StorableObject @endlink that can be extended by @link<DetailsHolder> DetailsHolder @endlink
 * class that holds object of Details type.
 *
 * Object of DetailsHolder type can hold extra information in instance of DetailsClass type. When
 * new value is assigned to Details field a @link<Manager::detailsLoaded detailsLoaded @endlink method of
 * ManagerClass is called with this object as a parameter (casted to Class type to avoid casting
 * at manager side). When old value is removed from Details field a @link<Manager::detailsUnloaded
 * detailsUnloaded @endlink method ManagerClass is called with this object as a parameter.
 * This allows Managers to show only these object, that have details loaded.
 *
 * Example of inheritance:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Contact: public DetailsHolder&lt;Contact, ContactDetails, ContactManager&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * First template parameter allows object to be properly casted.
