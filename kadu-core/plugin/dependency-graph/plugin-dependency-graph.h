 * Dependencies are two directional - each plugin has list of dependencies and list of
 * dependents. For each 'dependency' relation there is corresponding 'dependent' one.
 *
 * Dependency graph is created by adding plugins and relations between them. If dependency
 * relation is created for plugins that are not yet in the graph - they are added to it.
 *
 * All plugin that have dependency cycle can be obtained by calling findPluginsInDependencyCycle.
