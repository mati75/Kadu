 * is fetched from PluginMetadataProvider services. Then all plugins that form dependency cycles
 * are removed from list and dependency graph is created from remaining ones.  Metadata for these
 * plugins can be retrieived using for-range loop (as begin() and end() methods are implemented).
 *
 * Plugin list with all of its dependencies (or dependents) can be easily obrained by withDependencies
