 * Service used in PluginManager to handle exceptions of type PluginActivationErrorException.
 *
 * This implementation informs user by displaying error message dialog. In case exception occured
 * during program startup an additional checkbox "Load plugin at next startup" is offered to allow
 * user to enable/disable it. This case occurs when plugin state is already set to PluginState::Enabled
 * (this is checked by using PluginStateService).
 *
 * PluginActivationService is used to check plugin activation state after decision in erorr dialog was
 * made by user (as plugin could be activated in meantime).
 *
 * In other cases checkbox is not displayed (the assumption is that activation can only occur during program
 * startup or from configuration window, where this checkbox is not needed).
