Notice:

From time to time "Freedesktop icon specification"[*]  should be checked.
Maybe more freedesktop-icons are available now and some icons may be removed
from "kadu_icons" folder. The less icons here, the better because than we may
use system icons on Linux (both KDE and Gnome).

[*] Both official repo located at
  http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html
  (from 2006!) and unofficial (i.e.. just check if some icon is available in
  Ubuntu icon set and in Oxygen-KDE set, if the name of corresponding icon is
  the same in both sets then use it as "unofficial standard").
