	* Bugfix -- for the following scenarios:
	  1) Plugin unload, when there is at least one chat widget opened
	  2) Chat Widget close, when plugin is loaded
	  segfault occured. Now CompletionContext is deleted when either of
	  the above.

        * Added LoadByDefault=true to make it loaded by default when Kadu
          starts.
        * Fixed character encoding in plugin's description in
          kadu_completion.desc
